This file regroups hex editing notes I took during the making of my MM5 hack called Second Strike.

If you're interested in hacking MM5, the first thing you should do before reading this file, 
is to check the information available on MM5 at datacrystal. 
Then, you should check rock5easily's documentation (his website is in Japanese but google translate helps).

This current documentation only aims at being a small addition to rock5easily's documentation. 
His doc is the real deal and I don't know if I would have done anything without it.

I'm only a noob and some of the info here might be incorrect, so I apologize. This was my first steps 
into hex editing, but maybe this can help someone else who's just starting as well.

Proto Man Castle screen:

I started checking the Protoman Fortress level select screen, before deciding it wasn't worth the trouble.
Here is what I gathered about the "red dots" and the "white path" :

2f9f7 onward defines the white path. 
From what I gathered there are four bytes per sprite. X placement, Y placement, Type, and Orientation.

Types: 
(24: red dot)
25: straight line Y axis
26: straight line X axis
27: Junction

Orientation seem to only matter for the Junction type:
42: junction down
C2: junction up


2f86e onward : placement for the red dots? 4 bytes per dot?
