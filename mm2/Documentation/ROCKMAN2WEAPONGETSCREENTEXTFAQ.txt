Intro:
Hello everyone, I'm DragonMage98. Today, I'm going to teach you on how to edit the
text in the Weapon Get screen in ROCKMAN 2. Before we get started, there are a few
things you'll need:
* FCEUX (An NES Emulator with debugging features)
* RockMan 2 Rom (must be Japanese)
* HexEdit 4.0 (a Hex editor)
Once you have these, we'll begin on where to edit the text.

Weapon Get Screen:
NOTES:
DO NOT ADD OR REMOVE BYTES! Doing so will cause your game to freeze upon loading the ROM.
Otherwise, just change the bytes.
Also, do not change the 25 and 0D values. Doing so will not show that part of the message properly.
