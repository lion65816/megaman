[Music Definition]
$30A50 ...  Addresses of the beginning of the music and SFXs (Stored as little-endian 2 byte pointers).
    ex.)
        $30A50: D6 8A ... Track 00 begins at $8AD6($30AD6).
        $30A52: 1D 8E ... Track 01 begins at $8E1D($38E1D).

0F marks the beginning of a song, it is followed by 5 addresses corresponding to each channel track.
0F (SQ1) (SQ2) (TRI) (NOI) (MOD)

(MOD) shows where Modulation Difinition Table begins.

[Notes]
A note consists of a single byte found through (Y0 + XX).
    Y0 means the length of the note.  It must be 40, 60, 80, A0, C0, or E0.
        ex.) 60 is twice as long as 40.  80 is twice as long as 60, and is 4 times as long as 40. For musicians, you can think of EO as a whole note, C0 as a half note, etc
    XX means the chromatic tone of the note.
    It must be 01 through 1F.  00 makes the note rest. (so 40, 60, 80, A0, C0, E0 are always rests of the specified length)
    The actual pitch of any particular note is XX plus a base key set by operation code 05.
        So for instance, if you've set 05 15, the base note is A-2, which would mean notes would be 
            81 - A-2
            82 - A#-2
            83 - B-2
            84 - C-3
            ...
            8E - A#-3
            8F - B-3
            90 - C-4
            And so forth.
        Thus, you should find the lowest note you'll need for a section and start from there to save space from having to change starting note all the time.
    
    In NOI, XX shoud be 01 through 0F.  It means the tone of the note.

[Operation Codes]
Music is made of notes and operation codes.
00 to 3F are operation codes.
    00 XX ... Sets a tempo.  As XX increases, track speed slows.
    01 XX ... Sets a pitch envelope.  XX means the amount of change per frame.
        A plus value(00 to 7F) makes the note lower, a minus value(FF to 80) makes higher.
    02 XX ... Sets a duty cycle (timbre) of the track.
        In SQ1 and SQ2, XX shoud be 00, 40, 80, or C0. (12.5%, 25%, 50%, and 75% pulse widths)
        In NOI, XX shoud be 00 or 80. (the two types of Noise the NES can produce)
        In TRI, this does nothing, so it should be omitted.
    03 XX ... Sets a volume. Here referred to as max volume.
        In SQ1, SQ2, and NOI, set this using 31 - 3F (3F being max, 31 being minimum but not silent)
          This writes bit5-0 of XX on the bit5-0 of APU register $4000, $4004, $400C.
        In TRI, set 00-7F to set note length (larger value means to play longer).
          Setting 80-FF, the note will never stop playing.
          This writes whole XX on APU register $4008.
    04 NN XX YY ... Loop operation.  This means to jump to $YYXX NN times.  If NN is 00, this always jumps.
    05 XX ... Sets a base note on the chromatic scale. 
        Setting at 05 0A will make X1 notes the lowest starting notes that can actually play on the NES - A-1 in trackers like Deflemask.
        Each increase goes up by one half step, e.g.
            05 0B starts with A#-1, 05 0C starts with B-1, 05 0D starts with C-2, etc...
        The actual note that XX refers to is written at the below URL. (I have added an additional copy to the end of this file.)
        http://www.geocities.co.jp/Playtown-Bingo/2392/rock2m/r2musicfreq.htm
    06 ... A following note becomes dotted. (Its length is multiplied by 1.5x)
    07 XX Y0 ... Sets a volume envelope.
        Bit7 of XX is the direction of the change.
          0 is increase, from 0 to max volume.
          1 is decrease, from max volume to 0.
        Y0 is the amount of the change per bit6-0 of XX frame(s).
            Examples:
                07 81 10 - Bit7 is 1, so it's in the 80-FF range and the volume goes down from the max
                            Bits 6-0 are 01, so the change in Y happens every frame
                            Y0 is 1, so the volume changes by 1 every frame
                            So this is an instrument that starts at the full volume and decays 1 every frame
                07 84 20 - This note starts at full, and decays by 2 every 4 frames
                07 02 40 - This note starts at 0 and goes up by 4 every 2 frames
            etc
    08 XX ... Selects a Modulation Definition (from the table at the end of the song).  It must be 00 through 3F.
    09 ... End of the track. Only used for songs of finite length, obviously, but useful in testing to stop the game from crashing.
    2X ... 20-27 means tie.  Following X+1 notes are tied.
        ex.) "22 42 41 40" will play a note three times as long as normal 42.
        technique) "21 68 08 01 68" will change Modulation Difinition from the middle of the note.
    30 ... A following note will play a little shorter.   This is useful for tuplet notes.

[Modulation Definition Table]
This defines WW XX YY ZZ.
    WW XX ... This is pitch bend, useful for vibratos.
        Pitch is changed bit7-5 of XX per bit6-0 of WW frame(s).
        If pitch is changed bit4-0 of XX time(s), the direction of change will be inverted.
    YY ZZ ... This is volume modulation.  
        The volume will be changed from 0 to max volume, ZZ per bit6-0 of YY frame(s).
        bit7 of YY is the first direction of the volume mod.
          0 is increase, then decrease.
          1 is decrease, then increase.

    To disable all Modulation, write 00 00 80 00.

ex.) $8E15: 00 00 80 00 02 62 80 00
Two Modulations are defined.
    #0: 00 00 80 00 ... Both pitch and volume modulations are disabled.
    #1: 02 62 80 00 ... Pitch modulation is enabled.
        Freq. = 2, Amount = 3, Repeat = 2
Usage of this Modulations:
    08 00 41 ... Play 41 with Modulation #0, normal 41.
    08 01 41 ... Play 41 with Modulation #1, pitch modulated 41.

[SFXs Definition]
X0 0Y says that the SFX begins.
    X0 is the strength of the SFX.  The larger X is, the less the SFX is likely to be overwritten.
    0Y is what track the SFX uses(+01: SQ1, +02: SQ2, +04: TRI, +08: NOI).

[The Structure of SFX]
SFX have a sequentially data made of operation codes and register value.

Register value, XX YY, is (8000 + (0 through 7FF)).
If XX is 8F, it will do nothing, useful for change operations.

Available operation codes are below:
    00 XX ... Waits XX frame(s) for play next data.  XX shoud be over 02.
    01 XX ... Sets a pitch envelope.  This is same as music's.
    02 XX ... Sets a tone.  This is same as music's.
    03 XX ... Sets a volume.  This is same as music's.
    04 NN XX YY ... Loop operation. This is same as music's.
    05 WW XX YY ZZ ... Following data is applied a Modulation.
    06 ... End of the SFX.

ex.) $BB22($33B22): 
50 0A 02 00 03 3F 83 8A 00 06 03 3F 80 0A 80 35 00 09 02 80 01 FF 80 05
    50 0A ... SFX begins.  Strength = 5, Tracks = 08+02 = SQ2, NOI
    02 00 03 3F 83 8A ... SQ2 data.  Register value works as a separator.
    00 06 03 3F 80 0A ... NOI data.  The last track should include 00 XX.

    80 35 ... The next SQ2 data.
    00 09 02 80 01 FF 80 05 ... The next NOI data.

The order of track data is SQ1->SQ2->TRI->NOI.
