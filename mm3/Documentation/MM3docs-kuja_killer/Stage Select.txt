Stage Select/Title Screen/Get Weapon/Gameover Data
_____________________________________

Scanline Notes: 
3116D - Change from 58 to A7 ...the game reverses the scrolling directions...but scrolls from 2 sides rather than 1 from the other scanline affected area
31171 - change from 02 to 00 to take off scanline glitch for password/stage select screen. NOTE: the game will no longer scroll in 3 directions on these screens. but only 1...i have no idea how to fix the scanline so that the game will still scroll 3 directions. but this method still takes the line off. NOTE: Just use this offset and NOT 3116D for best possible results

Coding:
311D2 - CHR swap for stage select
