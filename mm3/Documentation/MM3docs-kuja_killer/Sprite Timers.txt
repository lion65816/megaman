Snakeman Stage
_______________
39645 - How long snakehead/upside down snakehead keeps mouth open after shooting
3964A - Time until next pellet shot from Snakehead and upside down snakehead
396A9 - Speed of small snakes bullets
3BA96 - Giant Snakes time until next attack phase
3bab2 - sprite tile id for shooting
3bada - speed of his shots
$0535 (RAM) - the number determines how many shots the Giant Snake will shoot on his next phase. This is random generated so I do not know how this works yet.
3BAF8 - How long giant snake keeps mouth open DURING shooting NOTE: This works differently than regular snakes, you'll have to change the value here and experiment with how it works. I'm not going into detail.
3bb61-3bb64 - number of times it shoots. 4 different settings
38C18 - Cannonball thrower: How long until the eye opens up so you can attack/until cannonball is thrown

Sparkman Stage
39503 - Spark Trap: Time left until next sparking phase
3B3B3 - How far sparker flys up and down repeatedly
39CF2 - Metool Bulldozer: Rest time when not moving
3958C - Time until next piece of trash sprite appears
3ABC4 - Bolt: How fast/slow the bolt moves as it's about to connect with the other side
3ACC1 - Bolt: Time until you can freely attack the bolt when it's connected. NOTE: in order for the bolt enemy to function properly, both values MUST be the same otherwise it'll mess up the connecting process of this enemy. Also, if value is set too high, then the bolt will NEVER connect thus making it so you can never defeat it.


Needleman Stage
3A376 - Delay timer 1 for after needler releases needles until rolling up in a ball
3A394 - Needler: How long he rolls on the ground for when curled up
3A422 - Delay timer 2 (2nd phase of delay timer 1)

397DC - Metool: Time until metool moves after shooting pellets
39888-3988A - Metool: Speed of the 3 bullets it shoots
39745 - Mosquito: Time until mosquito moves. Editing this is not recommended because during delay time, the mosquito moves up until the time it moves which will make it miss megaman much more frequently the higher the value is set
3B352 - Needle Upward, Downward: Time for how long the needle stays stretched out/invisable


shadowman:
